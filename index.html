        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of
            which is in
            one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts
            with its
            eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each
            step in time,
            the following transitions occur:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
            <li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the
            above rules
            simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the
            discrete moment
            at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one.
            The
            rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

        <h2>Game of Life Explanation</h2>
        <p>The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge
            mathematician John Conway.</p>
        <p>This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970.
            It consists
            of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the
            initial
            conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.</p>
